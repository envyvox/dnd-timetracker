The D&D Game Time Tracker App is a handy tool designed to help Dungeon Masters and players keep track of game time during Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) sessions. It provides a user-friendly interface with features like starting and pausing the game timer, as well as buttons to quickly add time to the session. This app simplifies the process of managing game time, allowing players to focus more on the game itself.

- Start and pause the game timer: The app allows you to easily start and pause the timer to track the duration of your D&D session accurately.

- Buttons for quick adding time: You can use the provided buttons to quickly add specific durations to the session timer, such as 2 hours or 8 hours.
